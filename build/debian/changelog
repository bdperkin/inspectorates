  * Converted from .rpm format to .deb by alien version unknown

    %doc dirs. (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - Fix headers so pod2usage will work again. (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - make spec happy (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - Homespun man2pod. (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - groff2pod in attempt to drop troublesome rman (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - remove debugging (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - Updated README markdown file. (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - spec and pod fixes (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - Ignore scratch directory. (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - Revert pod modifications. (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - Updated README markdown file. (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - Finish custom server/url code. (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - Respect server latency waittime. (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - Add Data::Dumper::Names module to get hash names. Remove unused MIME::Base64
    module. Document the debug variable. Make debugging output more dynamic so
    dev needs to do less text formatting. Document what numpingcount is to make
    it clearer how server or command-line args are used. Document what
    curloptverbose is and what it's settings are. Make it so custom server URL
    configuration passed overrides global speedtest settings.
    (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - Initial pass at custom URL. (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - Document CURLOPT_VERBOSE option. (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - More text formatting clean-up. (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - Significant improvement in upload tests and some text formatting.
    (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - Remove url2 as it has been dropped from the server xml. (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - Add option to turn on CURLOPT_VERBOSE Remove CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPALIVE,
    CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPIDLE, and CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPINTVL Print cURL versions (libcurl,
    zlib, libssh2, libidn, NSS, etc.) in debug mode (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - Slim the module imports Enable cURL TCP Keep Idle and Interval First pass at
    upload code. Added perl modules: Data-Random, GD, and WWW-Curl to spec
    requires. (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - Add TCP_KEEPALIVE and TCP_NODELAY options to the browser. Make ms since epoch
    a global variable and define it at conf retrieval time. Go ahead and force
    ever XPath retrieved value into a string value. Define the server 2 URL for
    the selected server. Add two download tests of largest download size against
    the server 2 URL. Smarter about which download sizes to get based on running
    speed average. (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - Changed HTTP Client Module from LWP::UserAgent to WWW::Curl::Easy after
    reviewing results from http-client-tests.  Curl is really the only choice,
    fuzzy results could be obtained from HTTP-Tiny, HTTP-Lite, Net-HTTP, and LWP-
    UserAgent would be the fall-backs if cURL is NOT available.
    (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - http-client-tests so the best HTTP client can be chosen (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - First pass at download code. (bperkins@redhat.com)
  - Changed HTTP Client Module from LWP::UserAgent to WWW::Curl::Easy after
    reviewing results from http-client-tests.  Curl is really the only choice,
    fuzzy results could be obtained from HTTP-Tiny, HTTP-Lite, Net-HTTP, and LWP-
    UserAgent would be the fall-backs if cURL is NOT available.
    (bperkins@redhat.com)

    (bperkins@redhat.com)
